# Mathematics State Exam Results Analysis
An analysis of Latvian secondary school state exams in mathematics with the aim of determining whether there are statistically significant differences between schools in Riga, state significance cities, regional significance cities, and the countryside. 

School network optimization is still a hotly debated issue in Latvia. It is often unclear how municipalities decide which schools to merge, close and keep open. One of many important factors that could guide the decisionmaking is student achievement as measured by state exams. Mathematics is an important subject for various technical professions that are in high demand. It is also considered the "toughest" exam as the scores are always the lowest compared to other subjects and many students each year fail it. Therefore it would make sense to consider these results in addition to other information when deciding which schools to close, merge and leave as is.

This project was initially created for a statistics class at the University of Latvia. After submitting it I realized I didn't include the high level exam (*augstākais līmenis*) and wanted to include data from it. This project is also an avenue to practice more efficient code writing, showcase my data analysis skills as well as learn some new data analysis methods. It's still a work in progress.
